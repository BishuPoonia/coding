SWPL - C Programming Training (LS_200820_001)

Assignment - Operators

Answer 01:

 in line 06: x = y == z;
 Firstly, our program will solve the right hand side of the expression
 i.e, "y == z" and then it will assign the result to left hand side
 variable i.e, "x". In this program, value of both "y" and "z" is 5.
 The operator "==" is used to compare two values for equality and return
 either True (1) or False (0). In this case, 5 is equals to 5 so this
 expression will take the value 1 (for True) and assign it in x.
 Hence, upon printing the value of x, displayed output will be 1.
